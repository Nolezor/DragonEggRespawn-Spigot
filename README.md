# DragonEggRespawn (Spigot)

Customize how many dragon egg should be spawned

---

### Permission Required:
dragoneggrespawn.*
dragoneggrespawn.seteggs
dragoneggrespawn.checkeggs
dragoneggrespawn.respawnedeggs

### Commands:
/seteggsremaining add/set number
Alias: seteggs

/checkseggsremaining
Alias: checkrem

/checktimesrespawned
Alias: checkres

### Additional Features
- Persistent data: both the max eggs to respawn and the times the egg gets respawned are saved in the config.yml so restarts and reloads won't change the values
- Custom fountain coordinates can be set in the config.yml (normally the fountain is located at (0, 0))

P.S. The egg spawn has a bit of dealy to prevent problems caused by the fountain reset after the dragon death
